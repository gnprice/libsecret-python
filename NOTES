- To get actual secret, need a Session.  Example:
    session = proxy().OpenSession('plain', Variant.new_string(''))
    secret = proxy('collection/login/870').GetSecret(session[1])
    value = ''.join(chr(i) for i in secret[2])

- Alternatively, see this doc for more context:
    https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/ch07.html
  So using pydbus *isn't* actually the same as using gi.repository.Secret;
  they both do use `gi`, but the latter is using it over libsecret (which
  underneath speaks DBus in a particular way), while the former is using
  it directly over DBus.  With libsecret, the secret would be kept in
  non-swappable memory (and then it'd be useful to encrypt it in transit
  to neutralize any swapping of intermediate buffers.)

  Though meh, I'm then going to be doing something *with* the secret,
  which I won't be able to keep confined to non-swappable memory.
  So maybe pydbus is a perfectly fine approach.

=====================

Important docs:

  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/

For reference on the specific API:
  https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Secret-1/classes/Collection.html

... or just open a REPL and start doing things like:
  print(bus.get('.secrets').Introspect())
  print(bus.get('.secrets', 'collection/session').Introspect())
  print(bus.get('.secrets', 'collection/login/870').Introspect())
  b = bus.get('.secrets', 'collection/login')
  dir(b)

Guess if we want to re-lock a keyring, we'll have to hack a way to
do it ourselves.  E.g., `echo 'libsecret lock ...' | at 'now + 2 min'`.

Also, some thoughts from the gnome-keyring author (and main author of
the Secret Service API) specifically about applications storing secrets
and other config:
  https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/authentication/2013-May/000267.html
Doesn't appear to have led to any concrete implementation, though; I
believe that's one of the last things he did before moving to other projects.

Hmm, it looks like when I'm prompted to unlock a keyring, the
"Automatically unlock whenever Iâ€™m logged in" checkbox is default-on!
I have to take care to uncheck it before hitting enter if I want to
avoid enabling that.

It's understandable why the author might have been inclined to point
the default in that direction -- the vast majority of users only ever
complain about these things when the keyring *doesn't* get
automatically unlocked, so they keep getting prompted for it.  But
nevertheless it seems like clearly the wrong behavior.  Partly because
of the steep asymmetry in consequences:
  * if it starts out unchecked and you hastily submit when you'd
    have liked to check it, the worst thing that happens is that you'll
    see the dialog box again;
  * in the reverse case, you may compromise the security of
    important secrets you've specifically tried to protect.

In any case, whatever the merits of this as a broad default, I
certainly want to turn it off for my specialized use cases.

Here's an illuminating old bug in that prompt's code (from 2011-02):
  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=642001
    and its fix: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-keyring/commit/e826634d

  Code first implemented, 2010-06-12: 9285289d7
  and major other parts, 2010-06-05: bf0d4ea4f

This code isn't changing much these days.  That file (1662 lines of C)
has not been touched since 2016-10-18; the last change that wasn't to
message strings was 2014-11-13; and the last significant change was
2011-12-19.  (By commit date; author dates are days to months earlier.)
